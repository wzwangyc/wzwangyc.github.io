# 👋 Hi, I'm Yucheng Wang (王煜诚)

I am currently an **M.Sc. candidate in Digital Financial Technology** at the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**, specializing in the intersection of **Quantitative Finance, AI, and Blockchain**.

Previously, I worked as a **Financial AI Algorithm Intern** at **Baidu Qianfan (LLM Division)**, where I developed *Meta-HCapsNet* (Hypergraph Capsule Networks) for financial time-series forecasting.

My passion lies in using **Algorithms** to decode financial markets and **Music** to decode emotions.

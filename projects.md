### 1. Meta-HCapsNet for Stock Prediction (Baidu Internship)
**Role:** AI Algorithm Intern @ Baidu Qianfan
* **Challenge:** Traditional time-series models (Transformers) struggle to capture high-order correlations between stocks in a non-stationary market.
* **Solution:** Developed **Meta-HCapsNet** (Hypergraph Capsule Networks). Designed a sparse dynamic routing mechanism to solve the cold-start problem in small-sample scenarios.
* **Result:** Outperformed SOTA baselines (iTransformer) by reducing MAE by **54%** in real-market backtesting.
* **Tech Stack:** `PyTorch`, `Hypergraph Learning`, `Capsule Networks`.

### 2. "Cai Meng Consensus Circle" (SSE Cup National Champion)
